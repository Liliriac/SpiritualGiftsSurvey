## Note

A friend sent me a pdf survey, I thought why not turn it to codes to make the experience much better? So here we are.

I created this site with the help of GPT-4 to offer a convenient online survey experience that provides instant results with ordered graphs and grouped answers to give a better understanding for your answers, also eliminates the need to manually fill out a PDF and perform those calculations yourself.
The content for this survey was taken from Lifeway Christian Resources:

- [LifeWay Women Leadership - Spiritual Gifts](https://www.lifeway.com/en/articles/women-leadership-spiritual-gifts-growth-service)
- [LifeWay Spiritual Gifts Assessment (PDF)](https://s7d9.scene7.com/is/content/LifeWayChristianResources/Spiritual_Gifts_Assessment.pdf)

little things I add are:
  1. default all answers to 3, so you can directly go the bottom and click done. Also if you want to modify some answers after click done, just modify it and click done again.
  2. a sorted graph to show your 16 gifts score.
  3. group all relevant questions under each gift and sorted by your score value.
  4. A small debug tool to export your answers (requires some computer science knowledge; to export your score for each question, access window.debug.q_score[0]).
