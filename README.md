## Note
I created this site with the help of GPT-4 to offer a convenient online survey experience that provides instant results with ordered graphs and grouped answers to give a better understanding for your answers, also eliminates the need to manually fill out a PDF and perform those calculations yourself.
The content for this survey was taken from Lifeway Christian Resources:

- [LifeWay Women Leadership - Spiritual Gifts](https://www.lifeway.com/en/articles/women-leadership-spiritual-gifts-growth-service){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [LifeWay Spiritual Gifts Assessment (PDF)](https://s7d9.scene7.com/is/content/LifeWayChristianResources/Spiritual_Gifts_Assessment.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}


little things I add are:
  1. default all answers to 3, so you can directly go the bottom and click done. Also if you want to modify some answers after click done, just modify it and click done again.
  2. a sorted graph shows your 16 gifts score.
  3. for each gift, I put all relevant questions under it and sorted by your score value.
  4. a little debugger to export your answers (need some cs skill, to export your score for each question, grab window.debug.q_score[0])
