        <p>This is not a test, so there are no wrong answers. The Spiritual Gifts Survey consists of 80 statements. Some items reflect concrete actions, other items are descriptive traits, and still others are statements of belief.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the one response you feel best characterizes yourself and place that number in the blank provided. Record your answer in the blank beside each item.</li>
            <li>Do not spend too much time on any one item. Remember, it is not a test. Usually your immediate response is best.</li>
            <li>Please give an answer for each item. Do not skip any items.</li>
            <li>Do not ask others how they are answering or how they think you should answer.</li>
            <li>Work at your own pace.</li>
        </ul>
	<p><strong>Your response choices are:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>5—Highly characteristic of me/definitely true for me</li>
            <li>4—Most of the time this would describe me/be true for me</li>
            <li>3—Frequently characteristic of me/true for me–about 50 percent of the time</li>
            <li>2—Occasionally characteristic of me/true for me–about 25 percent of the time</li>
            <li>1—Not at all characteristic of me/definitely untrue for me</li>
        </ul>

        Note: I created this site with the help of GPT-4 to offer a convenient online survey experience that provides instant results with ordered graphs and grouped answers to give a better understanding for your answers, also eliminates the need to manually fill out a PDF and perform those calculations yourself.
        The content for this survey was taken from Lifeway Christian Resources:
